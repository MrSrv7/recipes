          Indulge in a quick and clever breakfast for dinner with our hearty
          frittata recipe. It's packed with homey potatoes, salty bacon, and
          fresh kale. It's held together by an egg mixture that adds protein and
          gives the healthy 5-ingredient recipe a comfort food quality.

          A taco-stuffed panini is the perfect infusion of flavor to complement
          your weeknight dinners. OK, the panini is not actually stuffed with a
          taco, but all the flavors are there! Customize the Mexican-style
          sandwiches with your favorite purchased chunky salsa.

          Never tried jicama? It is a crunchy Mexican turnip, and I love to use
          it in this super easy salad. The jicama is ideal alongside the vibrant
          flavors of the tangerines and shallots. Between the sweet and sour
          flavors in this salad and its crunchy texture, it's all delish if you
          ask me. â€”Crystal Jo Bruns, Iliff, Colorado
