          Indulge in a quick and clever breakfast for dinner with our hearty
          frittata recipe. It's packed with homey potatoes, salty bacon, and
          fresh kale. It's held together by an egg mixture that adds protein and
          gives the healthy 5-ingredient recipe a comfort food quality.
