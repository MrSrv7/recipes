        Indulge in a quick and clever breakfast for dinner with our hearty
        frittata recipe. It's packed with homey potatoes, salty bacon, and
        fresh kale. It's held together by an egg mixture that adds protein and
        gives the healthy 5-ingredient recipe a comfort food quality.

        A taco-stuffed panini is the perfect infusion of flavor to complement your weeknight dinners. OK, the panini is
        not actually stuffed with a taco, but all the flavors are there! Customize the Mexican-style sandwiches with
        your favorite purchased chunky salsa.
